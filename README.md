# WeatherApplication

A weather application that should be able to fetch you weather data using SMHI's API (https://www.smhi.se/data/oppna-data/meteorologiska-data/)

Requirements:
nodejs, npm, python3

Usage:
cd into website directory, and type `npm install`. This installs all necessary dependencies. To launch the app, type `node app.js`. By default the server will listen at port 8888. To change this, change the variable `port` in `app.js` to your liking. The website will now be at `localhost:8888`, or whichever port you chose.
